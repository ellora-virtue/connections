# Connections

ðŸš§ _This project is a work in progress._ ðŸš§

Based on NYT Games' Connections game - a personal stretch project to flex my animation skills.

<br />

### Current state

- Currently, this project uses only one data set. In the future, this would be connected to a database of puzzles which would pull a new puzzle each day.
- Next I will be working on the animations and functionality that occur when submitting the correct answer. Please note that right now, if you submit a correct guess (or run out of mistakes remaining), nothing will happen. Stay tuned!

### Running the project
This project is not currently deployed anywhere, but you can run it locally by following the steps below:

<br />

**1. Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/ellora-virtue/connections.git
```

**2. Navigate to the project directory**

```
cd connections
```

**3. Install dependencies**

```
npm install
```

**4. Start the development server**

  Run the project on mobile:

  ```
  npm run ios
  ```

or 

```
npm run android
```

Or run the project on web:

```
npm run web
```

The development server should automatically open a localhost URL (e.g. http://localhost:3001) where you can access the app on a web browser.
